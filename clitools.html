        <h3>1. Funvfpred GUI Tool (Freelancing Project)</h3>
            <p>Collaborated with researchers to convert their Python-based code and machine learning model into a user-friendly graphical interface. While the core logic and model were provided by the researchers, I designed and implemented the complete GUI to make the tool accessible for non-programmers.</p>
            <p>The tool is fully containerized using Docker and runs in any environment where Docker is installed. It provides a browser-accessible GUI that requires no coding expertise to use.</p>

        <h3>3. ThyPredict Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
          A bioinformatics CLI tool for thyroid classification, developed using multiple model scripts written by team members. I integrated these scripts and models into a single, seamless pipeline to ensure end-to-end execution.
        </p>
        <p><strong>My Contribution:</strong> Integrated all stages into a single command-line pipeline, automated flow, handled error management, and managed GitHub deployment.</p>
        <p><strong>Team Contribution:</strong> Model development and core script creation by Nimisha (Stage 1 & 2) and Dr. Shweta (Stage 3) under the supervision of Dr. Dinesh Gupta.</p>

        <h3>4. Automated Deployment of Bioinformatics Tools for Workshop at University of Hyderabad</h3>
        <p>
         During a genome analysis workshop conducted at the University of Hyderabad, I was responsible for setting up more than 15 bioinformatics tools on over 30 computers. Manual installation on each system would have been time-consuming and error-prone. To overcome this challenge, I designed and developed automated shell scripts that included all necessary package installations and tool dependencies. These scripts were stored on a USB drive and executed with a single-click setup, significantly reducing installation time and ensuring consistency across all systems. This streamlined the workshop setup process, saved hours of repetitive work, and improved reliability.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills & Tools Used::</strong>  Shell scripting, Linux, Software Automation, Bash, Package Managers (apt/yum), Mamba, USB deployment</p>

        <p><strong>Team Contribution::</strong> All the shell scripts made by myself and Document prepared by: Anwesh Maile</p>

        <h3>5. AutoQii2 Pipeline</h3>
        <p>The AutoQii2 Pipeline can be used to analyzing 16S rRNA amplicon based datasets. AutoQii2 is primarily designed for eliminating multi-step analysis involved in analyzing paired-end or single-end reads using QIIME2. AutoQii2 uses popular fastQC, cutadapt and QIIME2 platforms for performing quality check, adapter trimming, ASV feature identification and taxonomic assignments.        </p>
        <p><strong>My Contribution:</strong>  Integrated all the steps into a single command-line pipeline.</p>

        <h3>6. Pipeline for Molecular adaptation analysis</h3>
        <p>The Molecular adaptational analysis were done on the bases of Six indices (referred to as cold-adaptor indicators) namely- frequency of acidic residues; proline residues; aromaticity; aliphacity; grand average of hydrophobicity (GRAVY); and the ratio of arginine (R) and lysine (K) were calculated to estimate cold adaptation at amino-acid level.</p>
        <p><strong>My Contribution:</strong>  Integrated all the steps into a single command-line pipeline.</p>
